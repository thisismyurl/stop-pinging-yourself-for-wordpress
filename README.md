# Stop Pinging Yourself for WordPress

[![WordPress](https://img.shields.io/badge/WordPress-6.4%2B-blue)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-pinging-yourself-for-wordpress/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL--2.0-blue)](LICENSE)

Stops a WordPress blog from sending pingbacks to itself when posts contain internal links. Eliminates the noise of self-pingback comments without disabling the pingback system entirely.

## Why this exists

WordPress sends a pingback every time a post links to another post — including self-links. The result is dozens of "pingback" comments cluttering the moderation queue with no value.

This plugin filters self-pings before they leave the site. External pingbacks continue to work as normal.

## Current implementation

- Namespaced plugin (`ThisIsMyURL\StopPingingYourself`) with `declare(strict_types=1)`
- Lean `pre_ping` callback that removes URLs prefixed by `home_url()`
- Legacy `thisismyurl-common.php` scaffold removed

## Features

- Blocks only self-referential pingbacks.
- Zero configuration.
- 600+ active installs and a 100% rating on WordPress.org.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.4+
- PHP 7.4+

## Status

Maintained and modernised for current WordPress and PHP baselines.

## Changelog

See [releases](../../releases) or [readme.txt](readme.txt).

## Support and donations

I build these tools because WordPress sites in the wild keep hitting the same problems, and a small, focused plugin is usually the right fix. They're free to use, with no tracking and no ads.

If one of them saves you time, here are the genuine ways to help:

- **Sponsor the work.** [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/thisismyurl) is the simplest way, and the Sponsor button at the top of this repo lists it alongside Bitcoin, Dogecoin, PayPal, and Interac e-transfer. Any amount helps, and none of it is expected.
- **Contribute code or ideas.** A pull request, a bug report, or a tested edge case is worth as much as a donation. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
- **Share it.** A note on [WordPress.org](https://profiles.wordpress.org/thisismyurl/), [GitHub](https://github.com/thisismyurl), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/thisismyurl) helps other people find work that might save them the same afternoon.

### Report issues and questions

- **Found a bug or want a feature?** Open an issue on the [Issues](../../issues) tab. Include your WordPress and PHP versions and the steps to reproduce it.
- **Have a question?** Start a thread on the [Discussions](../../discussions) tab.

### Contributing code

Code contributions are welcome. The short version:

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch with a clear name, like `feature/short-descriptive-name`.
3. Make your change and test it against the edge cases.
4. Run the coding-standards check before you open the pull request.
5. Open a pull request that explains what changed and why.

The full workflow and standards live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Contributing is never required, but it is always appreciated.
